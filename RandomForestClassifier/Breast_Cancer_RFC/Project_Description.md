# Random Forest – Breast Cancer (sklearn)

This mini project uses a **Random Forest classifier** on the classic **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)** dataset provided by scikit-learn.

The goal is to classify breast tumors as **malignant** or **benign** based on features computed from digitized images of fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) of breast masses.

It follows the same structure as the other projects in this repo: clean `.py` script, saved plots, and metrics in a `results/` folder so everything can be inspected directly on GitHub.
